A WIP sheep herding game that I am in the process of remaking. The previous code was so poorly fanagled the first time, that making the game was no longer fun. However, I spent a significant amount of time on the art and animations so I found it deserving of a redo! 

I'm working on it at the [UW GameDev Club](http://students.washington.edu/gamedevc/).
