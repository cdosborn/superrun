Todo:
horizontally sliding gate**
drop sheep on same level as bounding box
precompute random values ??
request animation frame
add sprite expiration method (after x time or smthng)
each sprite has a clear method that erases its bounding_box (calculate at what point its better to erase entire view)
remove "special numbers" ex. dx limit on super_run
fluid scaling (always ends on even power scale)
figure out if more efficient to have one fram animations set repeat to true or alternative?
change anim property repeat to be an index instead of a bool
scenes
dialog

Bugz:
bottom left corner of fence collison

Feature?
add scale specific features (zoomed in allows for sniffing flowers, entering buildings)
day and night cycle based off local time!
flowers give player endurance to carry many sheep 
add console input ability
sheep naturally wander to flowers

Completed
proper layering for drawing, every sprite represented by 3d (w X h X d)
