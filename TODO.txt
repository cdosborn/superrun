improve how sprites are layered
drop sheep on same level as bounding box
proper layering for drawing, every sprite represented by 3d (w X h X d)
precompute random values ??
request animation frame
add sprite ability to delete oneself (flowers)
add sprite expiration method (after x time or smthng)
add console input ability
each sprite has a clear method that erases its bounding_box 
remove "special numbers" ex. dx limit on super_run
fluid scaling (always ends on even power scale)
figure out if more efficient to have one fram animations set repeat to true or alternative?
efficient drawing (ideally only draws when necessary)
add scale specific features (zoomed in allows for sniffing flowers etc)
change anim property repeat to be an index instead of a bool
scenes
dialog
horizontally sliding gate**
